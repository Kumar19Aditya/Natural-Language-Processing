 NLP Concepts Repository

This repository contains various Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts, techniques, and code implementations. The files here cover essential topics in NLP, ranging from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques used in machine learning and data science.

 üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Techniques for cleaning, tokenizing, stemming, lemmatization, and handling stop words.

- **Feature Extraction:**  
  Implementations of TF-IDF, Bag of Words (BoW), Word2Vec, GloVe, and embeddings.

- **Text Classification:**  
  Code examples using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and advanced models like Transformers.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  End-to-end sentiment analysis with datasets, preprocessing, and model implementations.

- **Topic Modeling:**  
  LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and other unsupervised techniques to extract topics from text.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**  
  Identifying entities such as names, locations, and organizations using SpaCy and Transformers.

- **Text Summarization:**  
  Abstractive and extractive summarization techniques with implementation details.



2. **Install dependencies:**  
   The repository uses popular NLP libraries such as:
   - `nltk`
   - `spacy`
   - `gensim`
   - `scikit-learn`
   - `pandas`

 
3. **Explore the files:**
